#SpotiN
SpotiN is an immersive, local restaurant guide application with social-media-like features.

Our main goal is to help you locate the most delicious and authentic cuisine from local restaurants around Puerto Rico.

This application will aid the small local business to get some exposure on the trending mobile industry by providing them a place within our applications for FREE. This includes server space, IT support and adequate positioning within the query searches in our mobile applications.

Our team consists of four individuals, all born and raised in la "Isla del Encanto" Puerto Rico.
We know the Island in and Out. And its time that the world got to know her as well.

So come on and join us in our efforts to save the local commerce, one meal at a time!

SpotiN future work
While our main goal with SpotiN is to provide a local cuisine Tour Guide and planner for locals and tourist alike, we do not plan to stop here!

#Future work within SpotiN includes:

1) Local Tourist attraction around Puerto Rico

2) More connectivity with fellow "Spotters" around the island, so you can get real-time updates on tourist locations and restaurants.

4) In-depth information on localities and their history. For example: Did you knew that Puerto Mosquito (Mosquito Bay) in Vieques has the Brightest Bioluminescent Bay in the World. But if this one is too bright for you, we have two more Bio Bays around the island, One in Fajardo and another in Lajas! Puerto Rico has some of the world's most beautiful sights and natural resources, and we want to help you get there.

3) Built in customized maps to avoid dependency on external applications.

Here in SpotiN, we want to provide you with the most immersive experience as humanly possible. We want to take away the hassle of planning and looking around the internet for insight on possible locations. Why should you spend your time and energy on research when you should spend it on creating what can be some of the best memories of your life.

Sinceraly, SpotiN Team
